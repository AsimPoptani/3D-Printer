# 3D-Printer (feel free to add ideas)
Some ideas:

## Hardware
### Electronic Hardware

#### Controling motors
Use an Raspberry Pi to drive the and i2c expander PWM which will drive stepper drivers. Or do we just use an arduino connected to rpi? Stepper Motors include but not limited to a4988 and the drv8825. 

#### Stepper Motors
Not much research done here but Nema 17 looks like a popular choice

#### Nice to haves 
- LCD screen
- Camera


### Heating elements

#### Extruder 
Unkown research needed. Heard about a volcano end?

#### Extruder End
Unkown research needed. Heard about a Ruby end?

#### Direct drive or Bowden extruder
Aparently Bowden extruders are better less weight on the y axis.

#### Heat bed
Unkown more research needed

### Frame
#### Frame size?
The bigger we go the bigger the heat bed the bigger the stepper motors the bigger the power

#### Frame material 
What material?

#### Pre-made chasis?
Get a pre-made chasis with ideas to upgrade in the future


## Software
### Drivers
Need to build drivers for each component.
#### Auto Driver bed leveling 

### Marlin G-code
Need to implement Marlin G-Code or another popular G-Code

### Visual of what the 3D printer is doing?
Unkown more research required
